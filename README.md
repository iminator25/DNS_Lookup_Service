   This program was built in intellij and when running it I would recommed to go through that IDE.
   
   If you are having a problem running it make sure to edit the run configuratins and add the following line 
   in the "Program arguments:" field. "a.root-servers.net". Once that is done it should work fine. 
   
   When doing a lookup make sure to type "lookup" first. For example a normal request to google 
   would be follow the format:
   
   "lookup www.google.com"
   
   This was a school project that I had worked on and have added a couple of different features to make it
   more unique including making the responses more verbose and easier to understand.
