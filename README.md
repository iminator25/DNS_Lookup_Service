   This program was built in intellij and when running it I would recommed to go through that IDE.
   
   To run:
      - Edit run config on intellij, make sure that you are running the file "DNSLookupService" and in the run configs change the argument's to be one of the [IANA root servers](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers). Once this is done, you should simply be able to press run, then be promted to do a lookup which is explained below. 
   
   When doing a lookup make sure to type "lookup" first. For example a normal request to google 
   would be follow the format:
   
   "lookup www.google.com"
   
   This was a school project that I had worked on and have added a couple of different features to make it
   more unique including making the responses & errors more verbose and easier to understand.
